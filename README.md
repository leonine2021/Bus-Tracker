# Bus-Tracker

This project shows the bus line between Harvard and MIT campus on a interactive map.
Click "Show Stops Between Harvard and MIT", a series of markers will be triggered showing every stop along the bus line. There's also a popup with the logitude and latitude coordinates for the bus stop
Click "reset" to restart tracking.

Potential future development:
  1) Track the path with lines on the map
  2) Add more useful information for each stop
  3) Customize the style of the map
